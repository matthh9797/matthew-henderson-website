  An introduction to locally developing code for a batch ingestion process using python and the GCP API. In this article, I introduce the reason for this series of articles and the code.

## Tackling Automatic Data Ingestion in GCP

- Code: [github.com/matthh9797/gcp-ingest-template](https://github.com/matthh9797/gcp-ingest-template)

I remember right at the start of my career, when I bought the book [Data Science on GCP](https://www.google.co.id/books/edition/Data_Science_on_the_Google_Cloud_Platfor/F7tmEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) and opened the first chapter, titled "Ingesting Data into the Cloud", I thought to myself *"This part will be easy, I already know how to do this"*. Right? Wrong. What I did know then is how to develop solutions and as it turned out, productionising and automating the process had lots of new concepts and technologies for me to try get my head around.

So, it's two years later and on and off, I've kept on coming back to that first chapter with a different question. Why do I need a storage bucket? What is a service account? Why do I need Flask? Why the f*** is a docker container? ... but slowly I started to get my head around some of these concepts so I wanted to present this article on supporting repository as a note to the me of two years ago or anyone else who may be in this position now.

## GCP Ingest Template Repository

In this article I will introduce a process for batch data ingestion into GCP. You can use the code in the repository mentioned above as a starting point for any project where data ingestion is required as a first step by clicking on the "Use this template" button on github. I will step through the code, giving a sort of dummies guide to what it is doing. I will try to keep the explanations as simple as possible and avoid direct quotes from documentation and industry jargon.
