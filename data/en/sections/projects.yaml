  summary: >
    I designed and built a unified data model in dbt to consolidate all customer "trade" events, including sales, package changes, and churn, into a single source of truth.
    Collaborating with operational teams, I mapped user journeys to define event logic, implemented rigorous testing and documentation, and created a Looker dashboard that
    now serves as a trusted operational reporting tool. This solution enables the business to track customer movement,
    identify underperforming sales channels, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.
