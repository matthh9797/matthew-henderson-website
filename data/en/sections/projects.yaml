    To support the transition from a single-client setup to a multi-client model, I built a centralized Terraform repository for our analytics infrastructure on GCP.
    Working closely with Google’s DevOps team, I implemented CI/CD using Cloud Build to automate and standardize environment creation.
    This transformation allowed us to scale efficiently, spin up client-specific environments with ease, and significantly improved the reliability of our cloud infrastructure.

    To address persistent data quality issues, I implemented the dq-utils dbt package to log failing test results and link them to the original source data.
    I then built a Looker dashboard that provided real-time visibility into data issues, trend analysis, row-level drilldowns, and Jira integration for issue tracking.
    This solution enabled proactive data ownership, alerting system owners when quality thresholds were breached, significantly improving the overall reliability of our data.

  summary: >
    I designed and built a unified data model in dbt to consolidate all customer "trade" events, including sales, package changes, and churn, into a single source of truth.
    Collaborating with operational teams, I mapped user journeys to define event logic, implemented rigorous testing and documentation, and created a Looker dashboard that
    now serves as a trusted operational reporting tool. This solution enables the business to track customer movement,
    identify underperforming sales channels, and make data-driven decisions with confidence.

  # repo: https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha
  summary: >
    To address inconsistent and duplicated reporting requests, I developed a lightweight intake process based on BEAM data modeling principles.
    This involved collaborative sessions with stakeholders to define key user stories and metrics, an Excel mock dataset to map expected dimensions, and an ER model to assess feasibility.
    The process improved clarity, reduced duplicate requests, and enabled better prioritisation — ultimately streamlining reporting workflows and strengthening alignment between data and business teams.

  #url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: >
    I designed and developed a website for a jungle trekking company in Sumatra, aimed at boosting their online presence and increasing direct bookings. Over a 6-week sprint,
    I led the project end-to-end — from photography and design to content strategy and marketing — gathering regular feedback to iterate quickly.
    The result was a visually engaging, user-friendly site that significantly improved the company’s online booking rates and became a major driver of new income.
